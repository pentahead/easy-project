## üéØ Project Goal

This project is a web-based project management application designed to help users efficiently organize tasks and workflows. The main features of the application include boards, columns, and cards, enabling users to create, edit, and delete items as needed.

- Board: Represents a project, which can be created through the sidebar. Each board has a unique name and can be selected for viewing or management.
- Column: A section within a board used to group tasks by status. By default, every board includes three columns: Backlog, On Progress, and Done, with an option to add new columns.
- Card: Represents a task or work item that can be added to columns. Each card contains details such as task name, description, assignee, and image attachments. Cards can also be moved between columns using drag-and-drop functionality.
- Detail and Edit: Each card has a detailed view to display complete information and offers an edit option to update its data.

This application is designed to simplify project management for teams or individuals, providing a visual and interactive experience similar to popular tools like Trello but with customizable features.
